# COVID-19 Impact & Vaccination Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data using SQL to understand the **impact of the pandemic on populations** and to support **data-driven decision-making**.

The analysis focuses on tracking infection trends, mortality risk, and vaccination progress across countries and continents.  
Such insights are critical for **public policy planning, healthcare capacity management, and resource allocation**.

---

## 🎯 Business & Analytical Objectives
- Monitor COVID-19 spread and mortality trends across regions
- Identify countries with high infection and death rates relative to population
- Compare pandemic impact across continents
- Track vaccination rollout progress over time
- Support strategic decisions for healthcare planning and intervention prioritization

---

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used
- **Database:** MySQL  
- **Concepts:** Filtering, Aggregation, Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Temporary Tables, Views  
- **Dataset:** [Our World in Data - COVID-19](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)  
- **Tables:** `coviddeaths`, `covidvaccinations`

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Pandemic Impact Analysis
- Total cases vs total deaths
- Mortality rate calculation by country
- Percentage of population infected
- Countries with highest infection and death counts

### 2️⃣ Regional & Global Comparison
- Continent-level death analysis
- Global case and death aggregation
- Cross-country comparison for risk identification

### 3️⃣ Vaccination Progress Tracking
- Rolling vaccination totals using window functions
- Vaccinated population percentage by country
- Time-series analysis of vaccination adoption

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- A small number of countries experienced disproportionately high infection and death rates relative to population.
- Mortality risk varied significantly across regions, highlighting differences in healthcare capacity and response.
- Vaccination rollout speed differed widely between countries, impacting population-level protection.
- Rolling vaccination metrics provide better visibility into program effectiveness than daily numbers.

---

## 💼 Business & Policy Impact
- Helps governments and healthcare organizations identify **high-risk regions**
- Supports **resource allocation** and vaccination prioritization
- Enables **executive-level reporting** on pandemic status
- Assists analysts in tracking **program effectiveness over time**

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Import the datasets into a SQL database.
2. Create tables for `coviddeaths` and `covidvaccinations`.
3. Execute the SQL queries sequentially.
4. Use the created views for further reporting or visualization.
